# pinescript
This Pine Script indicator visualizes higher timeframe candles (e.g., 15min) directly on your current chart. It groups lower timeframe bars, then draws custom candlesticks with wicks and semi-transparent bodies, helping traders spot key support/resistance and price action without switching timeframes
